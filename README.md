# docker-gatsby

Docker file and script to build a gatsby container for website development

Requirements
* docker
* git
* [Notion.so](http://notion.so) account `FREE`
* Your own domain `~$10/year`
* GitHub account `FREE`
* Netlify account `FREE`
* Coding Knowledge: `2/5` 
(*Enough to know where a chunk of code starts and ends)*


1) Build a container for developing

```docker build https://github.com/kahunacoder/docker-gatsby.git -t gatsby-blog```

2) Start developing

```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog develop```

3) Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial.

## Make this site your own.

**Step 1: duplicate the table** 
Duplicate the table at https://www.notion.so/kahunacoder/b3189a381ce8490796fea90fa68310c2?v=4a46e38c7e514dee8ffbaf3ad690313e


**Step 2: Edit this piece of code into your gatsby-config.js file**
Replace the table url with the one you dupliucated at step one.
```jsx
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@kahunacoder/docker-notion-database`,
      options: {
        sourceConfig: [
          {
            name: 'posts',
            table: 'https://www.notion.so/kahunacoder/b3189a381ce8490796fea90fa68310c2?v=4a46e38c7e514dee8ffbaf3ad690313e',
            cacheType: 'html'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
]
```

**Step 3: Also edit the sites meta data into your gatsby-config.js file**
Replace the table url with the one you dupliucated at step one.
```jsx
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `KahunaCoder`,
    author: `Gary Smith`,
    description: `A blog.`,
    siteUrl: `http://example.com/`,
    siteVerification: {
      google: ``,
      bing: ``
    },
    social: {
      twitter: ``,
      linkedin: ``,
      facebook: ``,
      stackOverflow: ``,
      github: ``,
      instagram: ``,
      pinterest: ``,
      youtube: ``,
      email: ``,
      phone: ``,
      fax: ``,
      address: ``
    },
    keywords: ``,
    organization: {
      name: ``,
      url: ``
    },
  },
```

## 🧐 What's inside?
A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.
```
.
├── node_modules
├── src
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierrc
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
├── LICENSE
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── README.md
└── tailwind.config.js
```

**/node_modules:** This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

**/src:** This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for “source code”.

**.gitignore:** This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

**.prettierrc:** This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

**gatsby-browser.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

**gatsby-config.js:** This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail).

**gatsby-node.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

**gatsby-ssr.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

**LICENSE:** Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

**package-lock.json** (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

**package.json:** A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

**postcss.config.js:** The PostCSS configuration file where TailwindCSS is configured as a plugin and other plugins like autoprefixer or postcss-purgecss can be added.

**README.md:** A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

**tailwind.config.js:** The TailwindCSS configuration file, see their documentation for more information on how to customize Tailwind.
