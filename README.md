# docker-gatsby

Docker file and script to build a gatsby container for website development.

I built this because I didn't want to pollute my local machine with the libraries and software need to build a gatsby web site.

Requirements

* docker
* git
* code editor: `VS Code Recommended`
* Your own domain `~$10/year`
* Coding Knowledge: `2/5`
(*Enough to know where a chunk of code starts and ends)*)

Requirements for hosting a notion powered site on netlify

* GitHub account `FREE`
* [Notion.so](http://notion.so) account `FREE`
* Netlify account `FREE`

## Create your development envrionment

VSCode editor assumed here.

### Build a container for developing

Create a new folder for your project and open it with vs code and edit the build-arg for the folowing:

1. This is the name of the folder where your site will be created locally. `/site` is the default if you omit this option

```GATSBY_DIR="/site"```

1. This is the starter theme you want to use. I built this tool to support this starter `https://github.com/kahunacoder/gatsby-notion-starter.git` which had specific requirements for the software installed in the container. But the default starter also works. I haven't tested other starters and have no intention of supporting them but they may work. If you omit this option the default gatsby starter is used.

```GATSBY_THEME="https://github.com/kahunacoder/gatsby-notion-starter.git"```

1. The gatsby starters create a git repo to use if you include the following options. If you omit these options no repo is created.

```GIT_USER_NAME="Your Name"```
```GIT_EMAIL="you@youremail"```

Here's an example with all options entered.

```shell:
docker build \
    --build-arg GATSBY_DIR="/blog" \
    --build-arg GATSBY_THEME="https://github.com/kahunacoder/gatsby-notion-starter.git" \
    --build-arg GIT_USER_NAME="Your Name" \
    --build-arg GIT_EMAIL="you@youremail" \
https://github.com/kahunacoder/docker-gatsby.git -t gatsby-blog
```

This will build a gatsby blog using the `gatsby-notion-starter` and putting it in the folder `blog` and creating a `git repo` for it.

```shell:
docker build https://github.com/kahunacoder/docker-gatsby.git -t gatsby-blog
```

This will build a gatsby blog using the `gatsby-starter-default` and putting it in the folder `site` but `NOT` creating a `git repo` for it.

### Start developing

After step one finished paste the following line into your terminal. This assumes the default folder `/site`. Edit this if you used a different folder.

```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog develop```

### Check out the default site

The terminal will display this message.

Your site is now running at <http://localhost:8000>!

Note: You'll also see a second link: <http://localhost:8000/___graphql>. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial.

## Make this site your own

### Edit the sites meta data into your gatsby-config.js file

Replace the `siteMetadata` fields with your own. Remove options you don't use. This example is from my `gatsby-notion-starter` other starters will have different option to configure.

```jsx
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Site Title`,
    author: `Your name`,
    description: `A blog.`,
    siteUrl: `http://example.com/`,
    siteVerification: {
      google: ``,
      bing: ``
    },
    social: {
      twitter: ``,
      linkedin: ``,
      facebook: ``,
      stackOverflow: ``,
      github: ``,
      instagram: ``,
      pinterest: ``,
      youtube: ``,
      email: ``,
      phone: ``,
      fax: ``,
      address: ``
    },
    keywords: ``,
    organization: {
      name: ``,
      url: ``
    },
  },
```

These steps apply to my `gatsby-notion-starter` template.

### Duplicate the content table

Duplicate the table at <https://www.notion.so/kahunacoder/b3189a381ce8490796fea90fa68310c2?v=4a46e38c7e514dee8ffbaf3ad690313e>

### Edit this piece of code into your `gatsby-config.js` file

Replace the `table` url with the one you duplicated in the previuos step.

```jsx
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@kahunacoder/docker-notion-database`,
      options: {
        sourceConfig: [
          {
            name: 'posts',
            table: 'https://www.notion.so/kahunacoder/b3189a381ce8490796fea90fa68310c2?v=4a46e38c7e514dee8ffbaf3ad690313e',
            cacheType: 'html'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
]
```

### Save your changes and stop the development server

In your terminal hold the `control` key down and press the `c` key

### Restart the development server

 Verify your changes by pasting this (edit as needed) into the termianl and visiting <http://localhost:8000>

```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog develop```

Commands

* ```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog sh```
* ```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog develop```
* ```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog develop-no-cache```
* ```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog stage```
* ```docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/site:/site -p 8000:8000 gatsby-blog build```

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postcss.config.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tailwind.config.js
```

**/node_modules:** This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

**/src:** This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

**.gitignore:** This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

**.prettierrc:** This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

**gatsby-browser.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

**gatsby-config.js:** This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail).

**gatsby-node.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

**gatsby-ssr.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

**LICENSE:** Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

**package-lock.json** (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won‚Äôt change this file directly).

**package.json:** A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

**postcss.config.js:** The PostCSS configuration file where TailwindCSS is configured as a plugin and other plugins like autoprefixer or postcss-purgecss can be added.

**README.md:** A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

**tailwind.config.js:** The TailwindCSS configuration file, see their documentation for more information on how to customize Tailwind.
